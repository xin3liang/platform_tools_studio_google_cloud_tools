    name="App Engine Java Servlet Module"
    description="Creates the simplest example of an App Engine backend module containing a Java servlet.
    This module contains the smallest amount of boilerplate code, which makes it perfect for setting up
    the backend development environment in Android Studio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you need the features
    that Cloud Endpoints provide (such as automated object marshalling/unmarshalling) or
    push notification support, have a look at the &quot;App Engine Java Endpoints Module&quot; and
    &quot;App Engine Backend with Google Cloud Messaging&quot; templates.">
