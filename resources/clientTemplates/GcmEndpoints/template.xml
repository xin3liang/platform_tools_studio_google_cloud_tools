    name="App Engine Backend with Google Cloud Messaging"
    description="Creates a backend module which uses Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) to send
    push notifications from your server to your user's Android devices. The GCM service
    handles the queueing of messages and delivers them to the target Android application
    running on the target device. To register Android devices with your GCM server, this backend
    template uses Google Cloud Endpoints.">
